The main objective of this assignment was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the mocrobes that colonize human navels.
The dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

To make the dashboard interactive, a drop down menu was created for easy test subject ID selection. Eash selection displayed the corresponding demographic info in a box, adjusted the bar chart containing the top 10 OTUs, adjusted the bubble chart that displays each sample and also adjusted the guage chart that shows the scrubs per week (Belly Button Washing Frequency)
